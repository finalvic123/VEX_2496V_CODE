## TEAM 2496V BHS Robopatty Code
**Headers (.h)**
- *ports.h*
  - User defined equivalent of main.h, which isn't modified in the interest of seperating PROS code from user code
  - contains #define macros cortex port mapping
  - contains subsystem #define macros for various constants and such
- *subsystem.h*
  - Abstract base class containing mostly pure virtual functions that defines a basic motor system functionality for all motor systems to inherit from
- *main.h*
  - PROS predefined header with inclusion of the API and references to opcontrol(), auto(), and initalize() functions
- *api.h*
  - PROS predefined header with the library
- *robot.h*
  - contains references to subsytem instances initalized in init.cpp

**Heads (.h) + Source (.cpp)**
  - *DR4B.h + DR4B.cpp*
    - Contains lift subsystem child
    - Controls lift motors through P(ID) loop for auto and driver control
  - *Drive.h + Drive.cpp*
    - Contains tank drive drivetrain subsystem child
    - Controls drive motors (? with encoder master/slave ?) in driver control
    - Turn/drive distance functionalities for auto
  - *Claw.h + Claw.cpp*
    - Controls claw subsystem child with functionality for auto set position and driver operation and hold

**Source (.cpp/.c)**
  - *init.c*
    - Contains pregame code for LCD display & sensor debug including gyro and drive encoders
    - Gyro callibration
    - Subsystem initalization
    - Stops initalization thread for auto or opcontrol
  - *auto.c*
    - Autonomous code, handles autonomous thread creation/management
    - Autonomous failsafe thread
    - Stops autonomous threads for opcontrol
  - *opcontrol.cpp*
    - Driver control code, handles driver thread
    - Driver failsafe thread
    - Stops driver threads and deallocate waste memory

**NOTE: Skills challenge code written in RobotC not shown here.**

    Optimization TODO:
    -Delete unused variables
    -gyroDisable() and such
    -Remove unnecessary operations from loops
    -Thread optimization
